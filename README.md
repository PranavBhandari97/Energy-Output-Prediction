# Energy Output Prediction

## Problem Statement
#### The dataset contains information about Combined Cycle Power Plant. The goal of the project was to build a model that could predict the output energy of the power plant by taking Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Relative Humidity, and Exhaust Vacuum into consideration. The dataset is taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Model
#### An Artificial Neural Network was designed to solve this Regression problem.  The model had 4 layers; an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The input and hidden layers have six nodes each. The results can be seen in the notebook.
